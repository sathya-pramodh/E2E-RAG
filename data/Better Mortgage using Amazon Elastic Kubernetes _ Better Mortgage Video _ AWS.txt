Vishal Garg, founder and chief executive officer (CEO), discusses how Better Mortgage (NMLS #330511) uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to grow its business and launch innovative solutions such as Equity Unlocker and One Day Mortgage.  Equity Unlocker has revolutionized the concept of what qualifies for a down payment to purchase a home by enabling tech employees to pledge vested equity toward a down payment. Historically, in the traditional homebuying process, buyers would wait for weeks to receive a decision from their lenders. One Day Mortgage delivers a Commitment Letter in 24 hours and was built entirely on AWS. Better chose AWS because of its Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) and machine learning and articificial intelligence capabilities. Watch the video to learn more about Better’s journey of innovation.
